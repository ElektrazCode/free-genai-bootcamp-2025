## Notes

- I was very surprised that the model kept making grammatical mistakes and accepting erroneous translations.
- It kept adding the word "Do" (used in "do not") in the vocab table but giving it the meaning of the following verb, which did not make sense.
- Works a lot better when provided the instructions as an uploaded file.
