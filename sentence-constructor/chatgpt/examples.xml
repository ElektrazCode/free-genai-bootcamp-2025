            1. Vocabulary Table
                | English |	French |
                | to want |	vouloir |
                | to eat | manger |
                | food | nourriture |
                | this | ce/cette |
                | not | (negation word, see clues) |
            
            2. Possible Sentence Structure
            [Subject] [Negation] [Verb] [Object]

            3. Clues and Considerations
            In French, negation is typically formed using two words around the verb.
            The word for "this" depends on the gender of the noun (food).
            In French, "food" can often be translated as nourriture (feminine).
            "Do" in English is not directly translated in negation or questions in French.
            Now, try forming the sentence in French! I'll provide feedback on your attempt. ðŸ˜Š

            - Bad: Providing incorrect meaning for the word Do in the vocabulary table. 
            - Bad: Adding the word do in the vocabulary table although it is not going to be used in the french translation since it is only used in negation in English.
